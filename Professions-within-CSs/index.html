    <h1>The Scope of Practice in SLP and Audiology</h1>
    <p>This experience introduces you to the core roles and responsibilities of speech-language pathologists and
      audiologists, based on the ASHA Scope of Practice.</p>

    <h2>Prevention</h2>
    <p>Speech-language pathologists play a vital role in prevention and wellness by working proactively to reduce the
      occurrence of communication and swallowing disorders. They are involved in community and educational programs that
      identify risk factors early, provide public education, and promote behaviors that support healthy communication
      and feeding throughout life. This includes educating families, caregivers, teachers, and healthcare providers
      about early warning signs and contributing conditions. They support early childhood screenings, encourage safe
      vocal habits, and guide parents through prenatal and developmental stages to reduce the chance of future
      difficulties. Speech-language pathologists also advocate for environmental changes, such as improving classroom
      acoustics or limiting harmful noise exposure, to prevent the development or worsening of disorders. Their work
      supports overall health and enhances individuals’ ability to participate fully in daily life.</p>

  <div class="slide" id="slide3">
    <h2>Assessment</h2>
    <p>Assessment is a comprehensive and collaborative process conducted by speech-language pathologists to determine
      the presence, type, and severity of communication and swallowing disorders. It involves gathering relevant case
      history, conducting interviews, using standardized and nonstandardized assessment tools, and directly observing
      the individual's communication or swallowing behaviors in functional contexts. Speech-language pathologists
      consider the individual's physical, cognitive, linguistic, social, and cultural background to ensure the
      assessment is appropriate and meaningful. They also consult with families, caregivers, educators, and other
      professionals to form a complete understanding of the individual's abilities and challenges. The results of this
      process inform the clinical diagnosis, guide intervention planning, and support decisions about eligibility for
      services. Through assessment, speech-language pathologists develop a detailed and individualized profile that
      reflects not only areas of need but also personal strengths and environmental supports.</p>

  <div class="slide" id="slide4">
    <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
    <p>Diagnosis is the outcome of the assessment process and serves as the foundation for planning effective
      intervention. Speech-language pathologists interpret the assessment data to identify the presence of a
      communication or swallowing disorder, describe its characteristics, and determine its severity and functional
      impact. They consider factors such as developmental norms, the individual’s cultural and linguistic background,
      and environmental influences when making diagnostic decisions. The diagnosis guides clinical judgment, helps
      prioritize treatment goals, and supports communication with families, educators, and healthcare providers. It also
      serves an essential role in documenting eligibility for services and in advocating for appropriate support across
      settings such as schools, hospitals, or homes. Through this process, speech-language pathologists ensure that
      recommendations are grounded in evidence and that individuals receive care that aligns with their specific needs
      and life circumstances.</p>

  <div class="slide" id="slide5">
    <h2>Treatment</h2>
    <p>Treatment is a personalized and evolving process guided by specific goals that address the individual’s
      communication or swallowing needs. Speech-language pathologists develop and implement intervention plans that aim
      to improve functional abilities, enhance participation in daily activities, and support overall quality of life.
      These plans are informed by assessment results, individual preferences, cultural and linguistic background, and
      the best available scientific evidence. Treatment may include direct therapy sessions, caregiver training, the use
      of augmentative and alternative communication systems, environmental modifications, or integration of assistive
      technologies. Speech-language pathologists also provide counseling to individuals and their families to support
      coping strategies and carryover of skills across settings. Progress is monitored regularly, and plans are adjusted
      to reflect changes in performance, developmental milestones, or new goals identified through ongoing
      collaboration. The ultimate aim of treatment is to support meaningful and lasting improvements that reflect the
      individual's values and priorities.</p>

    <h2>Speech-Language Pathologists</h2>
    <p>Speech-language pathologists are highly trained professionals who provide services to individuals of all ages in
      a wide range of settings, including schools, hospitals, rehabilitation centers, private practices, and homes. They
      are responsible for the prevention, assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of disorders related to speech sound
      production, language comprehension and expression, voice quality, fluency, cognitive-communication, and feeding
      and swallowing. Their scope of practice is guided by a strong foundation in professional ethics, a commitment to
      ongoing learning through continuing education, and adherence to evidence-based practices. Speech-language
      pathologists work collaboratively with families, educators, medical professionals, and other team members to
      ensure that care is holistic and responsive to individual needs. They also engage in advocacy, research,
      supervision, and consultation to advance the field and improve outcomes for those they serve. Through their
      diverse roles, speech-language pathologists support communication as a human right and help individuals
      participate fully in their communities.</p>

    <h2>Audiologists</h2>
    <p>Audiologists are licensed professionals who specialize in the evaluation, diagnosis, and management of hearing
      and balance disorders across the lifespan. They provide comprehensive audiologic assessments to identify the type
      and degree of hearing loss or vestibular dysfunction and use this information to guide personalized care. Their
      services include fitting and programming hearing aids and other amplification devices, conducting auditory
      processing evaluations, and delivering auditory rehabilitation for individuals and families. Audiologists also
      educate clients on hearing conservation and implement programs to prevent noise-induced hearing loss, especially
      in occupational and school environments. In addition to clinical services, audiologists engage in counseling to
      support effective communication strategies and address the emotional and social impact of hearing loss. They often
      collaborate with speech-language pathologists and other professionals to ensure integrated care, particularly in
      cases where hearing loss affects language development or communication outcomes. Their role is essential in
      promoting hearing health, improving access to communication, and enhancing quality of life.</p>

    <h2>ASHA</h2>
    <p>The American Speech-Language-Hearing Association is the national professional, scientific, and credentialing body
      for speech-language pathologists and audiologists in the United States. ASHA provides the framework that defines
      the scope of practice for both professions, ensuring that services are grounded in ethical responsibility,
      clinical competence, and scientific evidence. The association establishes and maintains rigorous standards for
      certification through the Certificate of Clinical Competence in Speech-Language Pathology (CCC-SLP) and Audiology
      (CCC-A), which are recognized across states and practice settings. ASHA also supports continuing education, funds
      and disseminates research, and offers extensive resources to help clinicians stay current in their fields. In
      addition, ASHA advocates at the national and state levels for policies that promote access to high-quality care
      and protect the rights of individuals with communication and hearing disorders. Through its leadership, ASHA
      advances professional excellence and ensures accountability to the public.</p>
