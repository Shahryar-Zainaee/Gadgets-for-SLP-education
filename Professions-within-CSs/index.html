  <h1>Scope of Practice in Speech-Language Pathology and Audiology</h1>

  <p><strong>Prevention:</strong> Speech-language pathologists (SLPs) engage in prevention and wellness activities aimed at reducing the incidence of disorders in speech, language, swallowing, and communication. They educate families and communities, raise awareness of early signs of disorders, and promote practices that reduce risk factors‚Äîespecially in schools, prenatal settings, and among vulnerable populations.</p>

  <p><strong>Assessment:</strong> Assessment is a comprehensive process conducted by SLPs to identify communication, cognitive, or swallowing disorders. It includes case history, standardized tools, observational data, and collaboration with families and professionals. Culturally and linguistically appropriate practices are integral to ethical and accurate diagnosis.</p>

  <p><strong>Diagnosis:</strong> Based on assessment data, diagnosis involves identifying the presence and nature of a disorder. SLPs determine whether a client meets diagnostic criteria, document findings, and use instruments like videofluoroscopy, endoscopy, and AAC trials to guide treatment recommendations.</p>

  <p><strong>Treatment:</strong> Treatment includes restoring or compensating for impaired functions in speech, language, or swallowing. SLPs use evidence-based practices, including technology (e.g., AAC devices, telepractice), and work toward meaningful outcomes like school readiness, community participation, or health recovery. They adjust goals based on performance data and client values.</p>

  <p><strong>Speech-Language Pathologists:</strong> SLPs are autonomous providers with expertise in a broad range of conditions. They work in schools, clinics, hospitals, and homes to provide intervention across the lifespan. Their scope includes fluency, articulation, literacy, feeding, AAC, and counseling, grounded in professional competence and ethics.</p>

  <p><strong>Audiologists:</strong> Audiologists diagnose and treat hearing and balance disorders. They fit hearing aids, assess auditory processing, and counsel clients on communication strategies. Their services often overlap with SLPs, especially in pediatric and rehabilitative contexts, and they contribute to prevention of noise-induced hearing loss.</p>

  <p><strong>ASHA:</strong> The American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) provides the ethical, educational, and credentialing framework for SLPs and audiologists. ASHA promotes access to high-quality services, supports research and education, and ensures accountability through the CCC-SLP/A credentials.</p>
