      prevention: {
        title: "Prevention",
        text: "Prevention services aim to stop communication or swallowing disorders before they occur. According to ASHA, prevention focuses on minimizing risk factors, supporting normal development, and raising awareness about the consequences of these disorders. It includes sharing educational strategies, consulting families and professionals, and addressing cultural and linguistic diversity."
      },
      assessment: {
        title: "Assessment",
        text: "Assessment involves identifying and describing the strengths and challenges in communication, cognitive, or swallowing functions. ASHA states that assessments are guided by the World Health Organization framework and should consider the impact of disorders on daily participation, activities, and quality of life. Evaluations may be static or dynamic and are adapted to the client’s cultural and linguistic background."
      },
      diagnosis: {
        title: "Diagnosis",
        text: "Diagnosis is the process that follows a comprehensive assessment. It identifies specific communication or swallowing disorders and helps clinicians understand their nature and impact. ASHA indicates that diagnosis can include determining co-occurring conditions, predicting changes over time, and recommending follow-up support."
      },
      treatment: {
        title: "Treatment",
        text: "Treatment, also called intervention, focuses on improving communication or swallowing abilities. It helps reduce deficits, increase participation, and support long-term development. ASHA emphasizes that treatment should be person-centered, goal-oriented, and tailored to cultural and contextual needs. Treatment may include direct therapy, education, compensation strategies, or assistive technologies."
      },
      slp: {
        title: "Speech-Language Pathologists",
        text: "Speech-language pathologists (SLPs) are trained professionals who evaluate and treat speech, language, communication, and swallowing disorders. ASHA defines their roles broadly—from prevention and diagnosis to direct intervention and advocacy. SLPs often work in teams with families, educators, and medical providers and serve people across the lifespan."
      },
      audiologists: {
        title: "Audiologists",
        text: "Audiologists focus on hearing and balance. They assess hearing loss, fit hearing aids, provide aural rehabilitation, and educate clients on strategies to improve communication. ASHA highlights the audiologist’s role in both clinical care and prevention, often working alongside SLPs in collaborative teams to support individuals with hearing-related challenges."
      },
      asha: {
        title: "ASHA",
        text: "ASHA, the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, is the national professional, scientific, and credentialing body for SLPs and audiologists in the United States. It provides practice guidelines, ethical standards, certification, continuing education, and advocacy to support professionals and protect public welfare."
